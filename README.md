## Introduction
District heating involves the distribution of heat from a centralized source like a power plant or waste incinerator to various buildings for heating and hot water needs [1]. This system is particularly energy-efficient, cost-effective, and eco-friendly for urban regions in colder climates [2]. Accurate forecasting of district heat load, which is the required heat supply at a specific time [3], is crucial for efficient operation and planning of these systems. However, forecasting is complex due to the heat demand's non-linear and non-stationary characteristics.

Forecasting district heat load is a complex task that involves predicting future heat demand by analyzing historical data and various influencing factors like weather conditions and building characteristics [3], [7]. The challenge lies in the non-linear and non-stationary nature of heat demand, compounded by numerous influencing factors, which complicates accurate forecasting [6]. In response, researchers are increasingly turning to advanced machine learning (ML) methods, especially deep learning, due to their capacity for discerning intricate patterns and dependencies within data [8], [9]. Within this realm, active deep learning emerges as a particularly effective technique. It enables the model to selectively target the most informative data points within a vast and unlabeled dataset, thereby enhancing forecast accuracy and reducing the effort and expense of data collection [10]. This method is especially suitable for district heat load forecasting, given the often highly variable and intricate nature of the data involved [8].
